Hampi has been classified as a World Heritage Center and is one of the major tourist destinations in India.\n\nHampi, the seat of the famed Vijayanagara empire was the capital of the largest empire in post-moghul India, covering several states. The Vijayanagara empire stretched over at least three states -Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. The destruction of Vijayanagar by marauding Moghul invaders was sudden, shocking and absolute.\n\nAlthough in ruins today, this capital city once boasted riches known far beyond the shores of India. The ruins of Hampi of the 14th Century lies scattered in about 26 sq. km area, amIdst giant boulders and vegetation.\n\nProtected by the tempestuous river Tungabhadra in the north and rocky granite rIdges on the other three sIdes, the ruins silently narrate the story of grandeur splendor and fabulous wealth.\n\nThe splendId remains of palaces and gateways of the broken city tells a tale of man\u2019s infinite talent and power of creativity together with his capacity for senseless destruction. A visit to Hampi is a sojourn into the past. Most of the important structures and ruins are located in two areas, which are generally referred to as the Royal Centre and the Sacred Centre.\n\nA visit to Anegundi village by traversing the gushing Tunga Badra river on a coracle is an experience that provIdes the guests with a glimpse into the traditional country life in Karnataka."

The rIde would be accompanied by peals of laughter both from the passengers as well as the onlookers. Afternoon: Sightseeing tour of New Delhi.

Within its spacious courtyard stands the Iron Pillar, which dates back to the 4th century AD and bears a Sanskrit inscription in the Gupta style.

Today there are many temples, monasteries and schools here. McLeod Ganj has also attracted many foreigners who wish to study Tibetan Buddhism encouraging tourism and commerce in the Tibetan Community.

Its motif of flowers and foliage, minarets, mythological paintings, archaic furniture, wall hangings of arrows and shields have remained unchanged since hoary past. Here commercialism of artificial world could not slip in. Staying in Dundlod Fort is almost like living through the days of James Tod who described the splendors of Rajasthan. On every dawn the first ray of the sun befalls over the fort as an eternal bliss to the land of mystique and charisma. Later return to Mandawa. Overnight at the hotel."
