The buses were of good quality and punctual. Arrangements for water and breaks were very appropriate. We were informed in advance of the duration of each trip. The hotels chosen for us to stay in were of high quality and standard. At the time of the check-in, the hotel staff had our keys and rooms prepared, and there were very few delays. At each tourist site, we had excellent guides. They were knowledgeable about the historical sites and also about the history, culture, and economics of the area we were in. At one point our flight was canceled. Manoj brought his entire staff to pitch in. They arranged for alternative buses and found an alternative flight for the entire group. He kept us informed and guided us through the somewhat chaotic Indian Airports. In the end, he arranged for a grand farewell dinner with live music and dancing, which was fun. As I said, I also needed separate flights and ground transportation apart from the group. This too was done smoothly and without a hitch.

The first was the classic Golden Triangle -- New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra (the Taj Mahal), Varanasi, and other sites. our more recent two-week tour, completed just before Thanksgiving, took in Mumbai, Goa and the remarkable but lesser-known (to Westerners) ancient cave temples and monuments of India's exotic Southwest, including the ancient city of Hampi. At every site, the local guides arranged by EAZE were outstanding, true experts who spoke clear English and offered insights well beyond what we could find in guidebooks. All our hotels were comfortable; many with a lovely sense of place. The food was delicious. Our drivers and their assistants were skillful and gracious. Among the highlights of the trip were serendipitous interactions with the warm and generous Indian people. We even got to watch the set-ups for two weddings!

        "Content": "Eaze organized two different tours for us in the north west state of Uttarakhand. Trekking in India is not like Nepal where you have tea houses to stay in and have your meal cooked as well. All our gear had to be carried in and Harshit (owner of Eaze Tours) organized this for us. I was very impressed with his organization and in fact he accompanied us to Rishikesh to introduce us to the team that was going to look after us make sure we happy with the proceedings. I would definitely use Harshit and Eaze Tours again, whether it be for trekking or to organize transport within India Harshit also organized a free day tour of New Delhi which was very appreciated Our trip went fabulously well so thank you Harshit and Eaze Tours",

We wanted a very specific itinerary, to include ten days of trekking in the beautiful Himalayas, going to the source of the Ganges, visiting remote villages. High on the list was also emerging ourselves in the culture, food and festivals, unique to one of the most incredible, interesting, beautiful countries on earth. I absolutely recommend if you are considering visiting India, to get in contact with Eaze tours, you truly will experience the trip of a lifetime.",
